# Greenhouse-Monitoring-System
Greenhouse Monitoring uses Arduino/ESP32 with sensors to track temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. Data is sent in real-time to a mobile app or web dashboard. It helps maintain optimal conditions, improves plant growth, and enables automated alerts or actions for efficient greenhouse management.
