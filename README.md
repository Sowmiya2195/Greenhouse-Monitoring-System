Greenhouse Monitoring System
        A smart system using Arduino/ESP32 to monitor greenhouse conditions. It tracks temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels in real-time, helping maintain optimal conditions for plant growth. Data can be viewed on a serial monitor or IoT dashboard.

Components:
Arduino / ESP3
DHT11 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity).
Soil Moisture Sensor.
LDR (Light Sensor.

Working:
1. Sensors collect greenhouse data.
2. ESP32/Arduino reads and sends the data.
3. Data can be displayed on a monitor or sent to IoT for remote monitoring.
